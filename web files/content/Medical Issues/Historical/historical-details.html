<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The historical section of the secondary menu lists prior rating schedule criteria for several diagnostic codes; including those diagnostic codes that no longer exist. You will be given:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The old diagnostic code</li>
  <li>The original name</li>
  <li>The new diagnostic code that replaced it (unless it says it has been deleted)</li>
  <li>The date of the old criteria</li>
  <li>The old rating schedule criteria</li>
</ul>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">This will prove useful when working with cases that contain older, outdated diagnostic codes.</p>
