<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">Sight is among the important senses that provide perceptions to human beings about environmental stimuli and conditions outside of the human body. Structures and functions of the eye are constituents of the visual system.
</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The visual system includes the external and internal eye structures of the eyeball. The eye is the organ of sight that transmits images to the brain for interpretation. The external (extraocular) structures including the eyelids, eyelashes, conjunctivae, and lacrimal apparatus protect and lubricate the eyes. Readily visible anterior internal (intraocular) structures include the sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and pupil. Other intraocular structures are visible only with the use of an opthalmoscope or other instrument. These structures include aqueous humor, lens, ciliary body, vitreous humor, retina and choroid. The retina, the innermost layer of the eyeball, contains the tissue from the nervous system which receives visual stimuli.
</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The internal and external parts of the eye are controlled by extraocular muscles. Six cranial nerves innervate the eye, the ocular muscles, and the lacrimal apparatus. The coordinated action of the six cranial nerves control eye movement.

<h4 class="text-center">General Considerations for Rating</h4>

<ul>
	<li>When evaluating visual impairment, refer to 38 CFR 3.350 to determine whether the claimant may be entitled to special monthly compensation. Footnotes in the schedule indicate levels of visual impairment that potentially establish entitlement to special monthly compensation; however, other levels of visual impairment combined with disabilities of other body systems may also establish entitlement. (38 CFR ยง4.75)
</li>
	<li>Consider entitlement to ancillary benefits if Veteran meets eligibility criteria (38 CFR ยง3.155(d)(2)).
</li>
	<li>Refer to 38 CFR ยง4.75-ยง4.79 for additional considerations when evaluating eye conditions.
