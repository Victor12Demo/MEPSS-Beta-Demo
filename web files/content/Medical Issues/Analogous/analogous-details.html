<h4 class="text-center my-2">Analogous ratings.</h4>
<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">"When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. Conjectural analogies will be avoided, as will the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings. Nor will ratings assigned to organic diseases and injuries be assigned by analogy to conditions of functional origin". (38 CFR ยง 4.20 Analogous ratings)</p>

<h4 class="text-center my-2">Application of rating schedule.</h4>
<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">"In view of the number of atypical instances it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. Findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom, and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will, however, be expected in all instances". (38 CFR ยง 4.21 Application of rating schedule)</p>

<h4 class="text-center my-2">Analogous Codes in the Medical Electronic Support System (EPSS).</h4>
<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">It is emphasized that the list of analogous Diagnostic Codes provided in this EPSS is not all inclusive, nor is it the only way to rate these disabilities. The information provided consists of possible answers to rating these disabilities. There may be more than one correct answer to rate certain disabilities; some of the analogous code information provided will even suggest more than one diagnostic code as a suitable possibility. You should keep in mind, however, that these codes are not necessarily the only answers, and you will have to use your judgement as to whether they are applicable. There will be times when the facts of the case will require you to find your own analogous rating solution.

<h4 class="text-center my-2">Analogous Code Numbers in the Medical Electronic Support System (EPSS).
</h4>
<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The diagnostic code numbers included in this section are organized by body system, and are built up as described in ยง4.27 of the rating schedule. The first 2 digits are selected from that part of the schedule most closely identifying the part of the body, or body system, involved; the last 2 digits will always be 99. For example, the diagnostic code numbers for Chondromalacia patella is 5099-5260, with 50 referring to the section of the rating schedule involved (acute, subacute, or chronic musculoskeletal conditions) and 99 designating it as an analogous condition. The second set of numbers, 5260, refer to the code the condition is associated with (osteomalacia).
