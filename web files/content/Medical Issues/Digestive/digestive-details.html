<h2 class="text-center h1 my-4" id="overview">Digestive Overview</h2>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The digestive system (gastrointestinal system) has the chief responsibility of providing nutrients to body cells accomplished by a series of processes. Basic activities involved in the processes include: ingestion, intake of food; movement, passage of food through the gastrointestinal tract; digestion, breakdown of food chemically and mechanically; absorption, transfer of digested food into the circulatory and lymph systems for delivery to individual cells; and elimination (defecation), the removal of waste products of digestion (feces).</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract (alimentary canal) and accessory organs, which secrete enzymes that aid in the digestive process. The tract is approximately 30 feet long and extends from the mouth to the anus. The major gastro-intestinal structures include: the mouth, lips, tongue, esophagus, stomach and small intestines and large intestines. The accessory organs involve the liver, pancreas and gallbladder.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The mouth, pharynx and esophagus are involved in the intake of food, which is broken down and swallowed, and then propelled into the stomach. The mouth, stomach and small intestine are involved in digestion and absorption. Digestion begins in the mouth, including mechanical and chemical processes. The stomach stores food, mixes the food with secretions, and empties the resulting contents into the small intestine. In the small intestine, digestive enzymes break down nutrients so that absorption can take place. The function of elimination is the major role of the large intestine. Water and electrolytes are absorbed and feces are formed and held until defecation occurs. The functions of the digestive accessory organs (liver, pancreas and gallbladder) are focused on aiding the digestive process and participating in important metabolic processes.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">General Considerations for Rating</h4>

<ul>
	<li><b>Ulcers.</b>

	<p>Experience has shown that the term "peptic ulcer" is not sufficiently specific for rating purposes. Manifest differences in ulcers of the stomach or duodenum in comparison with those at an anastomotic stoma are sufficiently recognized as to warrant two separate graduated descriptions. In evaluating the ulcer, care should be taken that the findings adequately identify the particular location. (38 CFR §4.110 [Ulcers])</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Postgastrectomy syndromes.</b>
	<p>There are various postgastrectomy symptoms which may occur following anastomotic operations of the stomach. When present, those occurring during or immediately after eating and known as the "dumping syndrome" are characterized by gastrointestinal complaints and generalized symptoms simulating hypoglycemia; those occurring from 1 to 3 hours after eating usually present definite manifestations of hypoglycemia. (38 CFR §4.111 [Post-gastrectomy syndromes])</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Weight loss. (change made 1/23/02)</b>
	<p>For purposes of evaluating conditions in Sec. 4.114, the term "substantial weight loss" means a loss of greater than 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer; and the term "minor weight loss" means a weight loss of 10 to 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer. The term "inability to gain weight" means that there has been substantial weight loss with inability to regain it despite appropriate therapy. "Baseline weight" means the average weight for the two-year-period preceding onset of the disease (38 CFR §4.112 [Weight loss]).</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Coexisting abdominal conditions.</b>
	<p>There are diseases of the digestive system, particularly within the abdomen, which, while differing in the site of pathology, produce a common disability picture characterized in the main by varying degrees of abdominal distress or pain, anemia and disturbances in nutrition. Consequently, certain coexisting diseases in this area, as indicated in the instruction under the title "Diseases of the Digestive System," do not lend themselves to distinct and separate disability evaluations without violating the fundamental principle relating to pyramiding as outlined in §4.14. (38 CFR §4.113 [Coexisting abdominal conditions])</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Schedule of ratings—digestive system.</b>
	<p>Ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other. A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. (38 CFR §4.11 [Schedule of ratings-digestive system]) Additionally, please see M21-1, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section I - Conditions of Other Body Systems for additional information.</p>
