<h2 class="text-center h1 my-4" id="overview">Musculoskeletal Overview</h2>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The musculoskeletal system is the largest system in the body. About 25% of body weight is attributed to connective tissue and bony structures, and about 50% of the body weight is attributed to muscle mass. The musculoskeletal system is closely related to the neurologic and vascular systems, and there is an interdependent relationship with the rest of the body systems. This system includes bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments and bursae. The functions of the musculoskeletal system include: protection; support; locomotion; mineral storage; production and development of blood cells; and heat production. The bony structure and skeleton protect vital organs, e.g., brain, lungs and heart. The strong framework supports body structures, and body movement is made possible by muscles attached to the skeleton. Minerals are deposited and stored in bones, and the marrow in bones is responsible for the production of red and white blood cells. When muscles contract heat is produced in addition to mechanical actions.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">There are three types of muscles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>skeletal or striated-"are under voluntary control, are often attached to bone".</li>
	<li>cardiac-"a specialized type of skeletal muscle found only in the heart"</li>
	<li>smooth or visceral or involuntary-"not under voluntary control, found in walls of [the] digestive tract and blood vessels". (C&amp;P Training Letter 00-05 on Muscle Injuries and Related Problems; July, 2000)</li>
</ul>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">Muscles are attached by tendons or flat sheets of connective tissue, other muscles, soft tissue or skin. "Muscles have an origin at one end and an insertion at the other. The origin (the one that moves least on contraction) is often proximal, while insertion is distal. Sometimes a muscle arises from more than one place. It is then said to have two or more heads. Examples are the biceps and the triceps". (C&amp;P Training Letter 00-05 on Muscle Injuries and Related Problems; July, 2000)</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The size and shape of muscles are related to specific activities for which they are responsible. Age and disuse of muscle results in loss of function due to tissue replacement by fibrotic tissue. Muscle fibers contract in response to stimulation. Relaxed muscles are in a state of readiness to respond to stimuli. This state of readiness is called muscle tone. Muscles accomplish movement by contraction. Maintenance of muscle function and strength is an outcome of exercise.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">"Muscle actions are always described with the baseline being the standard position of the body, the anatomical position (arms at sides, palms forward). Certain muscle actions apply generally, but others are limited to a single region or a single joint".</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The range of movement of a joint is termed, range of motion (ROM). Common movements performed by muscles and joints are described below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flexion/Extension-"Flexion decreases the angle between two adjacent body structures; extension increases the angle."</li>
	<li>Abduction/Adduction-"Abduction is movement of a part away from the midline, either of the body or of the hand or foot. Adduction is movement toward the midline (toward the anatomical position)."</li>
	<li>Lateral/Medial Rotation-"Medial rotation means torsion of the distal bone so that a point on the lateral aspect of the distal bone is moved anteriorly or medially toward the body midline. Lateral rotation is the opposite".</li>
	<li>Circumduction-"A combination of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction." (C&amp;P Training Letter 00-05 on Muscle Injuries and Related Problems; July, 2000)</li>
</ul>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The 206 bones comprising the skeleton are categorized as follows: long bones (e.g., the thigh bone); short bones (e.g., the ankle); flat bones (e.g., the sternum); and small bones (e.g. the vertebrae). Bones are covered by a membrane called periosteum which serves in the nutrition and growth of bone, and provides for the attachment of tendons and ligaments. Nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics are contained in the periosteum. When two or more bones are joined together, joints are formed which provide for movement of the body. The joint capsule is lubricated and protected from pressure by a membrane called the synovium. Ligaments and muscle tendons passing over a joint provide stability of the joint. Types of joints include: ball and socket (e.g., hips and shoulders); hinge (e.g., elbows and knees); condyloid (e.g., wrists); saddle (e.g., thumbs); pivot (e.g., radius and ulna); and gliding (e.g., the carpals). Associated with some joints are bursae. These structures are located at points of friction, and are filled with synovial fluid. Bursae serve as cushioning structures in movement of tendons, ligaments, and bones at the elbow, shoulder, knee, and at other joints.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">General Considerations for Rating</h4>
<b>Ratings for Multiple Losses of Extremities</b>

<p>Review Table II of the "Ratings for Multiple Losses of Extremities with Dictator's Rating Code and 38 CFR Citation".</p>
<b>Evaluation of muscle disabilities.</b>

<ol>
	<li>An open comminuted fracture with muscle or tendon damage will be rated as a severe injury of the muscle group involved unless, for locations such as in the wrist or over the tibia, evidence establishes that the muscle damage is minimal.</li>
	<li>A through-and-through injury with muscle damage shall be evaluated as no less than a moderate injury for each group of muscles damaged.</li>
	<li>For VA rating purposes, the cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability are loss of power, weakness, lowered threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of coordination and uncertainty of movement.</li>
	<li>Under diagnostic codes 5301 through 5323, disabilities resulting from muscle injuries shall be classified as slight, moderate, moderately severe or severe as follows:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Slight disability of muscles.</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Type of injury. Simple wound of muscle without debridement or infection.</li>
			<li>History and complaint. Service department record of superficial wound with brief treatment and return to duty. Healing with good functional results. No cardinal signs or symptoms of muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.</li>
			<li>Objective findings. Minimal scar. No evidence of fascial defect, atrophy, or impaired tonus. No impairment of function or metallic fragments retained in muscle tissue.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Moderate disability of muscles.</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Type of injury. Through and through or deep penetrating wound of short track from a single bullet, small shell or shrapnel fragment, without explosive effect of high velocity missile, residuals of debridement, or prolonged infection.</li>
			<li>History and complaint. Service department record or other evidence of in-service treatment for the wound. Record of consistent complaint of one or more of the cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, particularly lowered threshold of fatigue after average use, affecting the particular functions controlled by the injured muscles.</li>
			<li>Objective findings. Entrance and (if present) exit scars, small or linear, indicating short track of missile through muscle tissue. Some loss of deep fascia or muscle substance or impairment of muscle tonus and loss of power or lowered threshold of fatigue when compared to the sound side.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Moderately severe disability of muscles.</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Type of injury. Through and through or deep penetrating wound by small high velocity missile or large low-velocity missile, with debridement, prolonged infection, or sloughing of soft parts, and intermuscular scarring.</li>
			<li>History and complaint. Service department record or other evidence showing hospitalization for a prolonged period for treatment of wound. Record of consistent complaint of cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section and, if present, evidence of inability to keep up with work requirements.</li>
			<li>Objective findings. Entrance and (if present) exit scars indicating track of missile through one or more muscle groups. Indications on palpation of loss of deep fascia, muscle substance, or normal firm resistance of muscles compared with sound side. Tests of strength and endurance compared with sound side demonstrate positive evidence of impairment.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>Severe disability of muscles.</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Type of injury. Through and through or deep penetrating wound due to high-velocity missile, or large or multiple low velocity missiles, or with shattering bone fracture or open comminuted fracture with extensive debridement, prolonged infection, or sloughing of soft parts, intermuscular binding and scarring.</li>
			<li>History and complaint. Service department record or other evidence showing hospitalization for a prolonged period for treatment of wound. Record of consistent complaint of cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, worse than those shown for moderately severe muscle injuries, and, if present, evidence of inability to keep up with work requirements.</li>
			<li>Objective findings. Ragged, depressed and adherent scars indicating wide damage to muscle groups in missile track. Palpation shows loss of deep fascia or muscle substance, or soft flabby muscles in wound area. Muscles swell and harden abnormally in contraction. Tests of strength, endurance, or coordinated movements compared with the corresponding muscles of the uninjured side indicate severe impairment of function. If present, the following are also signs of severe muscle disability:
			<ol>
				<li>X-ray evidence of minute multiple scattered foreign bodies indicating intermuscular trauma and explosive effect of the missile.</li>
				<li>Adhesion of scar to one of the long bones, scapula, pelvic bones, sacrum or vertebrae, with epithelial sealing over the bone rather than true skin covering in an area where bone is normally protected by muscle.</li>
				<li>Diminished muscle excitability to pulsed electrical current in electrodiagnostic tests.</li>
				<li>Visible or measurable atrophy.</li>
				<li>Adaptive contraction of an opposing group of muscles.</li>
				<li>Atrophy of muscle groups not in the track of the missile, particularly of the trapezius and serratus in wounds of the shoulder girdle.</li>
				<li>Induration or atrophy of an entire muscle following simple piercing by a projectile. CFR 38 §4.56 [Evaluation of muscle disabilities]</li>
