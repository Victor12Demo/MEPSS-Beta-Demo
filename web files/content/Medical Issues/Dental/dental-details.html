<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The major structures covered in this section include the teeth, the upper (maxilla) and lower (mandible) jawbones, and the roof of the mouth (hard and soft palate).</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The teeth are an essential component of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are 32 permanent teeth, 16 in the upper and 16 in the lower jaw. The different types of teeth are the incisors, canines (cuspids), premolars (bicuspids), and molars. They begin the action of digestion by performing mastication. Thorough mastication must take place before the remaining digestive system components can perform their part in the digestive process.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The maxilla pairs with other bones and several processes to form the skeletal base of most of the upper face, roof of the mouth, sides of the nasal cavity, and floor of the orbit. The maxilla holds and supports the upper teeth, which is the basis for calling the maxilla the upper jaw.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The mandible is the horseshoe-shaped bone that forms the lower jaw. It is the largest and strongest facial bone. It joins with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint. This union allows it to move making it the only movable skull bone. It holds and supports the lower teeth and consists of five major areas, the condylar process the coronoid process, the ramus, the angle and the body.</p>

<p class="px-5 mb-5 pb-3 lead blue-grey-text text-center">The roof of the mouth consists of the hard palate located at the front and the soft palate located at the back. The hard palate is made up of bones covered with mucous membrane. It separates the nasal cavity from the mouth. The soft palate consists of muscle and membrane. It partially separates the mouth and the pharynx.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">General Considerations</h4>

<ul>
	<li><b>Bruxism</b>

	<p>(excessive grinding of the teeth and/or excessive clenching of the jaw) cannot be evaluated as a stand-alone service-connected disability. However, as the condition may be a symptom of an anxiety disorder, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction, or some other disability, it may be considered on a secondary basis as a symptom of an SC disability for rating purposes.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Special Considerations</h4>

<p>Under 38 CFR ยง4.150, schedule of ratings-dental and oral conditions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For VA compensation purposes, diagnostic imaging studies include, but are not limited to, conventional radiography (X-ray), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide bone scanning, or ultrasonography.</li>
	<li>Separately evaluate loss of vocal articulation, loss of smell, loss of taste, neurological impairment, respiratory dysfunction, and other impairments under the appropriate diagnostic code and combine under ยง4.25 for each separately rated condition.</li>
