<h4 class="text-center">Infectious Diseases</h4>

<p>Throughout life, one is exposed to a variety of organisms and substances that are endless in number and capable of causing disease. Infectious diseases may be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa (single celled organisms), and worms. Infectious diseases have the potential to affect all systems of the body.</p>
<p>Within this section, the general systems affected by infectious diseases are the skin, special senses, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, gastrointestinal (digestive organs) and the digestive accessory organs (liver, pancreas, gallbladder). Manifestations of these diseases range from acute (rapid onset, short duration) episodes of fever and skin eruptions to death if the infection is not treated. However, most people experience only a few diseases during their lifetime because of numerous defenses, called resistance. This resistance is made possible by the immune system.</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Immune Disorders</h4>
<p>The immune disorders occur when the immune system is unable to recognize, inactivate or destroy foreign substances that invade the body. If the immune system is incompetent, disorders, diseases and malignancies may occur. If the immune system overreacts then allergies develop and tolerance to disease-causing substances (antigens) disappear causing autoimmune diseases to arise. This section covers three immune disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related illness and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).</p>

<h4 class="text-center">Nutritional Deficiencies</h4>
<p>Foods supply the nutrition needed to provide the body with energy, growth, maintenance and repair of body tissues. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals are contained in the foods we eat on a daily basis. A person's body build, age, gender, physical activity, and level of physical and emotional health influence the daily nutritional requirement.</p>
<p>A state of deficiency exists when a substance or substances essential for metabolism and health are lacking. These deficiencies may occur from excess loss, inadequate intake, or inability to absorb the necessary substances. The area of the body affected depends on the vitamin that is lacking. For example, major abnormalities that result from specific vitamin deficiencies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vitamin A deficiency causes interference with the eyes, trachea, hair follicles, and renal pelvis.</li>
  <li>Vitamin B complex deficiencies can cause disturbances in digestion, and function of the thyroid and the nervous system as well as problems in the liver. Deterioration of sex glands also can occur as well as untoward effects on the heart, spleen, and kidneys; enlargement of the adrenals; and dysfunction in the pituitary and salivary glands.</li>
  <li>Vitamin C deficiency causes problems in skeletal and teeth formation, injury to bone, cells, and blood vessels.</li>
  <li>Vitamin D deficiency also affects the bones and may lead to irregularities within the bones.</li>
  <li>Vitamin E deficiency decreases the ability of the red blood cells to resist rupture.</li>
  <li>Vitamin K deficiency causes prolonged clotting time that can result in bleeding.</li>
</ul>
